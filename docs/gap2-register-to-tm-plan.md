# GAP-2-E — register machine → Turing machine (the deferred dragon)

Builds `rm_to_tm(R)` : a Minsky `(u,v,a,q)` TM (the `tm.rs` formalism, G2-A) that **reaches the
origin config `(0,0,0,0)`** iff register machine `R` halts. Feeding it through the verified
`tm_to_modmachine` + `lemma_tm_h0_iff` (G2-B..D) realizes `R`'s halting set as `H₀`, discharging the
machine content of `ceer_realizes` (`src/ceer_relator_match.rs:81`, the sole open GAP-2 obligation).

Companion-confirmed design (port 8051, 2026-06-26): **Route A** (RM `k` → RM `2` → TM), unary-separator
tape, eat the unbounded walk with copy-loop-style monotone invariants, build `search_rm` at the RM level.

## The exact contract we must hit (`lemma_tm_h0_iff`, `tm_h0_bwd.rs:347`)

```
tm_wf(tm) ∧ tm_config_wf(tm, c) ⟹
  ( mm_in_H0(tm_to_modmachine(tm), rep1(c).0, rep1(c).1)  ⟺  ∃fuel. tm_halts_at(tm, c, tm_origin(), fuel) )
```

So `rm_to_tm(R)` must:
1. be `tm_wf` (m>1, 0<n<m, every quintuple wf, **deterministic** — ≤1 quint per `(state,scanned)`);
2. on the encoded init config `C(α)` satisfy `tm_config_wf` (scanned ≤ n, state < m, both half-tapes
   carry only symbol-digits ≤ n — the `digits_le` invariant);
3. **reach `tm_origin() = (0,0,0,0)` exactly when `R` halts** — i.e. a CLEANUP phase that blanks the
   whole tape and drops to state 0 on accept. `tm_origin()` is `tm_terminal` automatically (state 0 is
   below every quint's state ≥ n+1), so once we land there we stay (`tm_halts_at` true).
   If `R` loops, the TM must loop too and never transiently hit `(0,0,0,0)` (never use state 0 except as
   the post-cleanup halt; never present a fully-blank tape in state 0 mid-run).

## The tape layout — why **2** blocks, and why it's shift-free

Alphabet: `0`=blank, `1`=mark, `2`=separator (so `n ≥ 2`). States `≥ n+1`. The two-counter config
`(c1, c2)` ⟼ TM config with the head resting **on the separator** (`a = 2`):

```
 ... 0 0 | 1 1 … 1 |  (2)  | 1 1 … 1 | 0 0 …
         └─ c1 ───┘  head   └─ c2 ──┘
   u = repunit_m(c1)  (low digit = inner 1, nearest head)
   v = repunit_m(c2)  (low digit = inner 1, nearest head)
   a = 2,  q = current 2-counter state
```
`repunit_m(c) = 1+m+…+m^{c-1} = (m^c−1)/(m−1)`; note `repunit_m(c+1) = m·repunit_m(c) + 1`.

**Why exactly two blocks (the crux observation).** Each counter grows/shrinks **shift-free at its
OUTER (blank-adjacent) end**: c1 at the far left, c2 at the far right. A third block in a row would have
no free blank end → every inc/dec would have to *shift* the tail (an O(tape) insertion gadget). With two
blocks the separator never moves and no content is ever shifted:
- `inc(c1)`: walk left through c1's 1s to the blank, write a `1` (block extends left), walk back to `2`.
- `dec(c1)`: walk left to the outer boundary 1, blank it (left boundary moves right by 1), walk back.
- `zero-test(c1)`: **bounded** — peek `u % m` (the inner cell next to the separator): `1` ⟺ c1>0,
  blank ⟺ c1=0. (`[L write d][R write back]` restores `u,v`; nets only a state/scanned change.)
- c2 symmetric (right side, R-moves).

So the only unbounded gadgets are inc/dec (a walk to the outer end). Each is a single decreasing-fuel
loop whose invariant is the `multi_output_primitives::lemma_copy_loop_inner` pattern: "walk while scanned
is `1`, count carried digits; the carried digits return on the walk back." Concretely the gadget effect
is a clean repunit edit `repunit(c±1)` proven by induction, no tape-sequence abstraction needed — we work
directly in `(u,v)` arithmetic, mirroring the existing register copy-loop proofs.

## The reduction layers

```
 R = RegisterMachine(k)                                    [the CEER enumerator, or search_rm(e)]
   │  L0: build search_rm(e) at the RM level (dovetail the enumerator over stages; reuse
   │      embed_instructions + copy/triple-dist loop gadgets + lemma_embed_reaches_target).
   ▼
 RM(k)                                                     [Inc/DecJump/Halt, k registers]
   │  L1: k → 2  (Gödel)  — THE ONE OPEN SUB-DECISION (see below).
   ▼
 RM(2) = 2-counter machine                                [counters C1,C2; only Inc/DecJump]
   │  L2: 2-counter → TM  — the isolated hard core; build the unary-separator gadget library.
   ▼
 Tm  (rm_to_tm)
   │  G2-B..D (DONE): tm_to_modmachine + lemma_tm_h0_iff
   ▼
 ModMachine  with  H₀ = encoded halting set of R
```

### L1 (k → 2) — the one open sub-decision

The Gödel route `C = ∏ pⱼ^{rⱼ}` (one counter the product, one scratch) implements `Inc(rᵢ)` =
multiply-by-`pᵢ` and `DecJump(rᵢ)` = divisibility-test-and-divide-by-`pᵢ`. Multiply/divide-by-constant
on 2 counters are clean copy-loops (invariant `subtracted + p·quotient + partial = original`, **no
number theory**). The divisibility *test* loop is likewise pure arithmetic. The ONLY number-theoretic
fact is connecting the test back to the register: `pᵢ | ∏ pⱼ^{rⱼ} ⟺ rᵢ ≥ 1`.
- `rᵢ ≥ 1 ⟹ pᵢ | C`: trivial (factor out one `pᵢ`).
- `rᵢ = 0 ⟹ pᵢ ∤ C`: needs **Euclid / coprimality** (`pᵢ` coprime to each other `pⱼ`). This is the
  only genuinely number-theoretic obligation in the whole dragon.

Alternatives that avoid Euclid both have their own cost, so they are NOT obviously better:
- **k-block tape** (skip RM(2), put k unary blocks on the TM): inner blocks have no free blank end ⟹
  every inc/dec needs an insertion/shift gadget. Worse than one Euclid lemma.
- **pairing/interleaving** encode (r₀..r_{k−1}) into one counter: decode/encode is triangular-number /
  Cantor-pairing arithmetic on counters — messier than Euclid.

**PICK: Gödel-primes (Option A), isolate the Euclid fact to a single lemma** (`lemma_prime_div_godel`).
Two companion passes disagreed (one → Route A, one → Option C "avoid number theory, use a shift gadget"),
because the second glossed the **shift gadget**: in the `(u,v)` Minsky model, inserting a `1` into an
*inner* block is a genuine O(tape) shift loop (carry a symbol through the state, window invariant), and
shift-free growth is possible only for **≤2 blocks** (the two far blank ends). So the real trade is
*one standard Euclid lemma* (Option A) vs *a bespoke shift-gadget loop* (Option C). Option A wins:
its 2-block TM gadgets are shift-free and the k→2 multiply/divide reuse the existing copy-loop infra;
Euclid is bounded, self-contained, low-risk (check `vstd::arithmetic` first, prove from scratch if absent).
L1 is **not on the critical path** — the L2 TM gadget library below is needed identically regardless, so
build L2 first and settle the Euclid lemma when L1 is reached.

### L2 (2-counter → TM) — the universal foundation, build FIRST

Parametric-in-layout gadget library over the unary-separator tape (k=2 is the special case; the gadgets
are written once and reused). Bottom-up brick order (companion's priority):

- **B0 `tm_run` composition lemmas** (`tm.rs` analogs of `machine.rs`): `tm_run` split
  (`tm_run(f1+f2) = tm_run(tm_run(·,f1),f2)`), monotone, determinism, halted-identity, and a
  `tm_halts_at` ∘ composition lemma. Needed to chain every gadget. **← start here, unblocked.**
- **B1 layout spec** : `two_counter_config(c1,c2,q) : TmConfig` (= `(repunit(c1), repunit(c2), 2, q)`),
  `repunit_m`, and `lemma_two_counter_config_wf` (`tm_config_wf`: digits ≤ n, since repunit digits ∈{0,1}).
- **B2 zero-test gadget** (bounded): `[L peek][R restore]`; `lemma_zerotest` — lands in one of two
  states by `c=0?`, config otherwise unchanged.
- **B3 inc gadget** (walk-left loop + write + walk-back): `lemma_inc` — `two_counter_config(c1,c2,q)`
  runs to `two_counter_config(c1+1,c2,q')` in a computed fuel.
- **B4 dec gadget**: `lemma_dec` — to `two_counter_config(c1−1,c2,q')`.
- **B5 per-instruction simulation** : assemble Inc/DecJump quintuple blocks (relocated like
  `embed_instructions`), prove one 2-counter step ↔ one gadget run; thread `tm_wf` determinism.
- **B6 run simulation + cleanup** : induct over the 2-counter run; on halt, the cleanup phase
  (`dec` both to 0, blank the separator, state→0) reaches `tm_origin()`. Gives
  `rm2_halts(R2,in) ⟺ ∃fuel. tm_halts_at(rm_to_tm(R2), C(in), origin, fuel)`.

### G2-F (wiring, after L0–L2)

`config_encode` (currently the `(0,0)` placeholder in `modular_reduction.rs`) is OURS to define — pick it
to equal the TM init layout for input `decode(α)`. Then `lemma_tm_h0_iff` + `decode∘ρ` (GAP-1, proven)
identify `mm_in_H0(mm, enc(a,b)) ⟺ declared_equiv(e,a,b)` and discharge `ceer_realizes`.

## Invariants & guard-rails
- No `assume` / `admit` / `external_body`. Full end-to-end.
- The TM stays deterministic: per-instruction quintuple blocks use disjoint state ranges; `tm_wf`'s
  "≤1 quint per (state,scanned)" is discharged by construction (each `(state,scanned)` keyed uniquely).
- Never transiently hit `(0,0,0,0)`: simulation states are all ≥ n+1 and ≠ the final halt state; the
  blank-tape-in-state-0 config appears only as the genuine post-cleanup origin.
- Work in `(u,v)` arithmetic with repunit formulas + decreasing-fuel loop lemmas (no separate tape-seq
  abstraction) — matches the verified `multi_output_primitives` copy-loop style.

**Status 2026-06-26:** design locked (this doc). Building B0 (`tm_run` composition) first.
